2: Create a Button on the page using JavaScript. Add an event listener to the button that changes the button's color to green
when it is clicked.

3: Create an input element on the page with a placeholder "enter your name" and an H2 heading on the page inside HTML
The purpose of this input element is to enter a user's name so it should only input letters from a-z, A-Z and space (all other
characters should not be detected). Whenever the user inputs their name, their input should be dynamically visible inside the heading.
[Note: No other character apart from the allowed characters should be visible in the heading.]
