Events are signals that tells us that something has occured on the page. (user inputs/ actions).
Firstly we will talk about handling inline events.

onclick (When an element is coding). 
onmouseenter (When mouse enters an element).

: Event Listener
addEventListener
syntax: element.addEventListener(event, callback); 2 parameters -> event, callback
callbacks are basically functions that goes as an argument in another function:

eg: btn.addEventListener("click", function (){
    console.log("Button was clicked);
});

For a single object we can assign multiple eventListener
